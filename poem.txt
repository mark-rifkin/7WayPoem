I AM A FISH
I find the other fish suspicious
One could call them fishy
I swim and swim around the bowl
My tail is getting itchy...
But if only I were a llama
I would not have this itchy tail
I could go OUTSIDE the bowl
Abandon my old fishy trail
I should just become A LLAMA...
But the llama that I know
Is not a very nice llama
He spits in my face
And is very mean
But my friend Horsie the BEAR is nice...
Horsie the BEAR was bare
He was shaved by the birds
Which he proceeded to eat
And then he ate the fish
which as it turned out
was not his friend
but then again
he was not a llama
so he could do nothing
but fail
